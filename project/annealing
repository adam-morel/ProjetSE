states of the physical system ~ solutions de combinations
cost of a solution: energy of a sate.



try to move to a better solution
we want to move toward a solitoni that id better? 

local/global maxima. trying to find a local close to the global ( or the global but we cant know)

how to jump to a worst solution to search for a better one?
check if neighbours is better => accept
else => 2 things
- how much worse ? => small change => easy to accept
- how high are we ? => at high temperature, the system will more likely accept worse answers ( https://youtu.be/jR9RtOBHAAo?t=246 )

random initial solution ( but not THAT random)
run the loop ( n iterations)
